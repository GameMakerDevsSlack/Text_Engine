///read_me___obj_juju_portrait()
//  
//  Portraits are typically used to provide context and visual feedback during a conversation
//  with an NPC. Whilst obj_juju_portrait is usable outside this context, the object is
//  designed with being linked to a dialogue box in mind.
//  
//  scr_juju_portrait() creates an instance of obj_juju_portrait and then links it to a
//  dialogue box. The dialogue box must already have been created by scr_juju_dialogue().
//  Command tags allow the developer to adjust sprites and image indices of individual
//  portraits by referencing the tags attached to each portrait on creation.
//  
//  
//  obj_juju_portrait can be tweened via scr_juju_animate().
//  
//  
//  obj_juju_portrait does not hold any additional variables.
